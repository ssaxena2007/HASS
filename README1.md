MAEKE UC hackathon entry
We specify YouTube channels from which we can grab shorts using YT api (taking their latest videos and checking if they are shorts or not).
If the videos are shorts then we store it in a json format, the rest are ignored
All this must be done beforehand, repeating this step every time a user wants a response would be unnecessary.
When the user enters a keyword (ex: python, java, OOP) we will use the gemini api to fetch all the json files that match the user entered keyword
